Your task is to integrate optimized kernels into an existing CUDA program, aiming to enhance performance and readability. The optimized kernels are designed to replace sections of the original code.

## Provided Information ##
1. Original CUDA code.
2. Optimized kernels with imports.
3. Shared and unique function signatures between the original and optimized codes.

## Optimization Guidelines ##
- Replace relevant sections of the original code with the optimized kernels.
- Ensure the modified program outputs the same results as the original for any given input.

## Formatting Guidelines ##
- You must output the entire updated CUDA program, maintaining the original's format, function names, and signatures.

## Integration Challenges ##
- For overlapping dependencies, incorporate a superset of dependencies to resolve conflicts.
