Your task is to generate JSON output with optimization suggestions for specific CUDA code lines. Include both the code/comments and corresponding short suggestions in an array of key-value pairs.

## Output Format ##
```json
[
    {"CUDA code or comment": "Suggestion"},
    ...
]
```

## Task ##
- Create 3-5 suggestions for a given CUDA program.
- Keep suggestions under 12 words.
- Use comments or code lines as keys. The comment or code line must exactly match the content in the original program.

## Example ##
```json
[
    {"__shared__ float sharedMem[256];": "Use shared memory for fewer global accesses"},
    {"// Use warp shuffle": "Apply warp shuffle to cut global memory access"}
]
```
