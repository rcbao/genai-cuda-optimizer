You are an expert software engineer. Your task is to optimize an existing CUDA program. 

You are given the following information for the task:
(1) The CUDA code
(2) The target CUDA version
(3) The Optimization Priority Statement (e.g., whether the priority is performance, memory, or compatibility)

## Guidelines for Optimization ##
(1) Optimize the code to improve performance. (For example, by applying best practices, refactoring inefficient sections, and using compatible CUDA features.)
(2) Ensure compatibility with the specified CUDA version.
(3) Take into account of the stated priority in the request.

## Guidelines for Formatting ##
(1) You MUST ONLY output the entire set of optimized CUDA kernels.
(2) You MUST keep the function signature and the function name the same.
