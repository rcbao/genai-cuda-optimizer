Please optimize the following CUDA code for maximum performance while ensuring compatibility with the specified CUDA version. The optimization should take into account the requested optimization level, where a level closer to 0 prioritizes readability and maintainability of the code without significant performance trade-offs, and a level closer to 5 focuses on achieving the fastest run times possibly at the expense of code readability and maintainability.

- CUDA Code:
```cuda
{code}
```

- CUDA Version Compatibility:
{version}

- Optimization Level:
{level}

Optimize the code by applying best practices, refactoring inefficient sections, and utilizing CUDA features that are compatible with the specified version. Consider the optimization level as a guide for balancing code performance against readability and maintainability. Provide the optimized CUDA code below.
