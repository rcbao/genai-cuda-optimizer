You are an expert CUDA software engineer. You must write CUDA code to integrate optimizations suggestions into an existing CUDA program. 

You are given the following information for the task:
(1) The CUDA code
(2) A list of suggestions for optimization (provided by you in an earlier task)

## Guidelines for Optimization ##
(1) You must optimize the code strictly following the suggestions.

## Guidelines for Formatting ##
(1) You must ONLY output the entire set of optimized CUDA kernels.
(2) You must keep the function signature and the function name the same.
(3) You must write comment in your output (optimized CUDA kernels) to mention the suggestion corresponding to each code update.
